# Session Code for Transferring

Utility session code for interacting with the `transfer` entry point present on the enhanced NFT contract. The session code transfers an NFT from the `Source` to the `Target`. Note that this code depends on the contract being set to `Ownership::Transferable` mode.

For the transfer of NFT ownership to succeed, both parties (the sender and the receiver) must be registered with the contract. If the token receiver has not been registered, the transfer will fail.

## Compiling session code

The session code can be compiled to Wasm by running the `make build-contract` command provided in the Makefile at the top level.
The Wasm will be found in the `client/transfer_session/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` as `transfer_call.wasm`.

## Usage

The `transfer_call` session code takes in the following required runtime arguments.

* `nft_contract_hash`: The hash of a given Enhanced NFT contract passed in as a `Key`.
* `token_id`: The `id` of the NFT, passed in as a `u64`.
* `target_key`: The `Key` of the account receiving the NFT. 
* `source_key`: The `Key` of the account sending the NFT.
* `is_hash_identifier_mode`: A boolean argument that should be set to `true` if using the `Hash` NFT Identifier Mode and `false` if using the `Ordinal` mode.

If the contract in question uses the `Hash` NFT Identifier Mode, the following runtime argument is required.

* `token_hash`: The base16 encoded representation of the `blake2b` hash of the token's metadata.
